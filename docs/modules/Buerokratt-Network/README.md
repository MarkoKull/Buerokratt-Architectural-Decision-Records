### About Bürokratt Network

Bürokratt Network serves the functionality of connecting Bürokratt Instances (clients) to be able to communicate each other without knowing any of the technical details about each other.

It also serves the goal of Bürokratt Core Team communicating Bürokratt Instances, and vice versa. Bürokratt Core Team uses it mainly to notify Instances about software updates and to gather generic, non-intrusive metrics about them. Instances, on the other hand, use it to send updates about their planned downtimes, changes in technical settings (for example, IP-addresses), etc.
